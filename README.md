# Gettingdatafromserver
Overview:
This project demonstrates how to fetch and display data from a server (API) using Angular’s HttpClient module. The experiment focuses on performing HTTP operations such as GET requests, handling responses, and rendering the received data dynamically in the component template.It helps understand how Angular interacts with backend APIs and how data binding and observables work together in a real-world application.

Objectives:Learn how to integrate APIs in Angular using the HttpClientModule.
.P.erform HTTP GET requests to fetch data from a remote server or local JSON file.
.Understand the concept of Observables and RxJS in data handling.
.Display fetched data dynamically using property binding and *ngFor directive.
.Handle loading states and error responses gracefully.

Features:
.Fetches data from an external server or local API.
.Uses Angular’s HttpClient for communication.
.Displays data in a structured and user-friendly format.
.Includes basic error handling for failed requests.
.Demonstrates service-based architecture for reusability and clean code.

Technologies Used:
.Angular (latest version)
.TypeScript
.RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript)
.HTML / CSS
.Node.js & npm (for Angular CLI)
